# OpenGL Test Repository

Just a simple OpenGL playground to learn about OpenGL programming and GLSL
language.

For now just draws a triangle but in a future I would like to implement a
[mandelbrot set visualizer](https://github.com/mjkloeckner/mandelbrot)

Most of the code was developed following [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)
tutorials

## Dependencies

- OpenGL (at least version 3.30)
- Glfw
- Glew

## Building and Running

$ make -j $(nproc)
$ ./opengl
```
